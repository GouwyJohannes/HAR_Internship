Installing jupyter notebook:

	Open commandline in the Python_Prediction folder
    Type the command to install jupyter notebook "pip install jupyter notebook"
    Type "jupyter notebook" to run
    This will open in your browser where you can select the file you want to run

To run the application I've added an document with the steps.
The application is only for andriod devices.

The application is not finished. I've included a zip file with a project that I used as a base. It also shows how to do it for iOS devices.
